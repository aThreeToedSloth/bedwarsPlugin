A Spigot plugin for Minecraft that lets you play a basic version of Bedwars.

**Commands:** <br/>
  -[/setlobbyspawn] command to set the lobby spawn point, this is where players will be teleported to when the game ends or if they join the server while a game isn't in progress. <br/>
  -[/setteamspawn <0-7>] command to set the player spawn point for specific teams. This is where players will be teleported to when a game starts or if they die when a game is in progress. <br/>
  -[/setbedspawn <0-7>] command to set the bed spawn point for specific teams. This is where beds will spawn when a game starts. <br/>
  -[/start <2-8>] command to start a game (You can have up to 8 teams). <br/>
  -[/end] command to end a game. <br/>

**Features:** <br/>
  -Restrictions on when players can place and break blocks. <br/>
  -Customise the spawn points of teams and beds. <br/>
  -If a game is in progress, players spawn with a kit that includes armour, a sword, a pickaxe and some blocks. <br/>
  -No respawn screen, players respawn automatically when they die. <br/>
  -Each team has a bed when the game starts, if it gets destroyed then the team loses the ability to respawn and players will be eliminated if killed. <br/>
  -Teams are eliminated once all their players are eliminated. <br/>
  -Game ends once only one team remains. <br/>

  **How to play:** <br/>
  -Teams spawn on islands in the sky with beds. (The islands are not included in this plugin and have to be created by the player, the commands provided above can be used to set spawn points to these islands.) <br/>
  -The aim is to break the bed of the other teams, then kill the players to eliminate them from the game. <br/>
  -Use the blocks that you are given to build bridges to other islands. <br/>
  -Protect your own bed from getting broken. <br/>

  **Notes:** <br/>
  -Beds are currently just wool blocks. <br/>
  -The play area should not go beyond 100 blocks in the x and z coordinates from the centre of the world as blocks will not be reset properly when the game ends. <br/>
